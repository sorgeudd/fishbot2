# Change Log - February 24, 2025

## Recent Changes

### Mouse Movement Improvements
- Added normalized coordinate system (0-1 range) for window-independent tracking
- Improved boundary detection to prevent mouse getting stuck
- Added position change detection to avoid redundant recordings
- Increased polling interval to 250ms to reduce overhead
- Added detailed coordinate logging

### Sound Trigger System
- Fixed action parameter handling in add_sound_trigger
- Added proper initialization of new triggers
- Improved error handling with stack traces
- Enhanced logging for trigger creation and saving

### Emergency Stop Functionality
- Enhanced F6 emergency stop to properly halt all operations
- Added checks to stop mouse capture and macro recording
- Improved button state management after emergency stop
- Added user feedback messages

## Known Issues
- Mouse movement was pulling to the left consistently (Fixed in latest update)
- Sound trigger saving had missing action parameter (Fixed)
- Emergency stop (F6) needed improvement (Fixed)

## Discussion History
- Identified issues with mouse movement tracking and coordinate translation
- Implemented normalized coordinates for better window independence
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Fixed syntax errors in GUI components
- Improved error handling and user feedback

## Next Steps
1. Test updated mouse movement tracking with normalized coordinates
2. Verify sound trigger creation and saving
3. Validate emergency stop functionality
