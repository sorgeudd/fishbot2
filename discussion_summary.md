# Fishing Bot Development Discussion - February 24, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Mouse Movement Problems
- Initial issue: Mouse consistently pulling to the left
- Solution implemented: 
  - Added normalized coordinate system (0-1 range)
  - Improved window boundary detection
  - Added position change tracking
  - Increased polling interval to 250ms

### 2. Emergency Stop (F6)
- Initial issue: Emergency stop not working properly
- Fixed by:
  - Adding global key binding
  - Properly stopping all operations
  - Adding UI feedback
  - Improving error handling

### 3. Sound Trigger System
- Initial issue: Missing action parameter
- Solution:
  - Fixed action parameter handling
  - Added proper initialization
  - Improved error handling
  - Enhanced logging

## Current Status
The mouse movement issue persists despite initial fixes. Current debugging approach:
1. Added detailed coordinate logging
2. Implemented normalized coordinates
3. Added boundary checks
4. Increased polling interval

## Next Steps
1. Further debugging of mouse coordinate translation
2. Verification of window offset calculations
3. Testing of normalized coordinate system
4. Enhanced logging for troubleshooting

## Log Analysis
Recent logs show:
- Mouse coordinates being tracked
- Window boundary checks working
- Emergency stop functioning
- Sound trigger parameter handling improved
